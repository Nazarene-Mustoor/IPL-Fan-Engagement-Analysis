# IPL-Fan-Engagement-Analysis 
OVERVIEW
This thesis investigates the correlation between fan engagement intensity during critical moments of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches and the performance of individual players. Critical moments include close finishes, pivotal overs, key wickets, and match-turning events. Utilizing Python for data scraping and analysis, we categorized fan engagement into high and low intensity groups and employed T-tests to compare player performances across these groups. The study reveals a significant correlation between heightened fan engagement and improved player performance in high-pressure situations, suggesting that the external environment plays a pivotal role in influencing player outcomes. The findings contribute to the existing literature on sports psychology and fan behavior, offering valuable insights for team management, broadcasters, and league organizers. This research underscores the importance of understanding the dynamics between fans and players, paving the way for further studies on the impact of audience engagement on athletic performance.
